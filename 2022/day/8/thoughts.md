Good to be back after some time away from advent of code.

This one looked like it would be hard, but I took my time with it, drawed a matrix to help me think better, and both solutions were right on the first try :yay:

I'm getting tired of using `global` variables. I'm not really a fan of OOP, but at least it's better then this. Maybe I should refactor...
