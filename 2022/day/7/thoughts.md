Well, this one took a long time. A lot has happened, besides me just simply losing my patience. But I actually came back and did it, and in a fairly efficent way too.

I ended up using a tree after suffering through a generic dictionary and something (that I haven't found to this day) not working.

The tree is actually O(n) space, which is kinda nice for a tree with an arbitrary number of children. It uses the `left-child, right-sibling` representation.

The code is really ugly, so I may come back and refactor it to make it more readable, but for now I'm satisfied.
